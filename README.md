# React Hooks

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. They were introduced in React 16.8 to simplify and streamline React component code by allowing developers to manage state and side effects in functional components.

## React Hooks

### 1. useState
Manages state in functional components.
```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

### 2. useEffect
Handles side effects in functional components, such as fetching data or directly interacting with the DOM.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
}, [count]);
```

### 3. useContext
Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

```javascript
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```

### 4. useReducer
An alternative to useState for managing more complex state logic.

```javascript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

### 5. useCallback
Memoizes a function, preventing it from being recreated on every render.

```javascript
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
``` 

### 6. useMemo
Memoizes a value, recomputing it only when its dependencies change.

```javascript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

### 7. useRef
Creates a mutable object that persists for the lifetime of the component, often used to reference DOM elements.

```javascript
const myRef = useRef(null);
```

### 8. useImperativeHandle
Customizes the instance value that is exposed when using ref.

```javascript
useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
  customFunction() {
    // Custom function logic
  }
}));
```

### 9. useLayoutEffect
Similar to useEffect, but fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. Useful for measuring DOM nodes.

```javascript
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  // Code here
}, []);
```
